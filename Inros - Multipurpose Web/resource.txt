--1 -> She then expatiated very warmly upon the advantages I should reap 
       from her plan; talked in a high style of my future grandeur; 
       assured me how heartily I should despise almost every body and every 
       thing I had hitherto seen; predicted my marrying into some family of the



--2 -> Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner 
       with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening.

--3 -> You cannot too assiduously attend to Madame Duval herself; but I 
       would wish you to mix as little as possible with her associates, who are not 
       likely to be among those whose acquaintance would reflect credit upon you.



--4 -> Almost instantly the whole truth of the transaction seemed to rush upon her

       for one half of what he said was oaths.



--7 -> I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, 
       finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. 
       The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery



--8 -> his recital put the Captain into an ecstasy; he went from the lady to the gentleman, 
       and from the gentleman to the lady, to enjoy alternately the sight of their distress. 
       He really shouted with pleasure; and, shaking Monsieur Du Bois strenuously by the hand



--9 -> Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired to double. 
       When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, 
       and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate,
